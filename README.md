#################################################################################################### ### ###     Canvas for Highlighting: PopupMenu ### ###        This class allows you to bind an arbitrary PopupMenu to a canvas ###     widget object. When the mouse passes over the object, the PopUp Menu ###     can be called by way of a Right Button Click. In theory, the popupmenu ###     should pertain to that particular widget. However, it is unknown how ###     exactly this will play out. Future edits may be necessary ### ### ###         V 1.0.0    Feb 13, 2021
